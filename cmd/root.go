	Short: "A CLI to quickly convert .mp4 to .mov-files and vice-versa",
	Long: `mp4-to-mov is a CLI specifically designed for Davinci Resolve users on Linux,
as it is not possible to use mp4-encoded files with an acc-audio codec.
This tool is meant to quickly convert .mp4-files to a usable .mov-fileformat
with pcm_s16le audio-encoding.

The same process can be made in reverse, so rendered projects can be shared
in an .mp4-format. Converting files can be done recursivly in
subdirectories or just the given directory.
Converted files can be replaced or stored in a new subdirectory.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
